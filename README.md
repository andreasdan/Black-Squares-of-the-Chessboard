- Exercise 1: Write a program, which through a nice print shows a
way (column and row number) the way our pawn
chooses to walk from the upper left corner to another
given black square
- Exercise 2: Extend the answer from Exercise 1, so the pawn can
begin at the upper left corner of the board and through
exactly 13 moves reach the lower right corner. I.e. it
must touch exactly 14 squares.
It is not allowed for the pawn to enter the same square
more than once.

Options to test exercises while running the program, are included in a console menu (System.in).
